      <h2>What data do we collect?</h2>
      <h3>Parts of the Services</h3>
      <p>
        Let you interact with other users or share content publicly, including by posting reviews about content, asking or answering questions, sending messages to students, or posting photos or other work you upload. Such shared content may be publicly viewable by others depending on where it is posted.
      </p>

      <h3>Educational Content Data</h3>
      <p>
        When you access content, we collect certain data including which courses, assignments, practice tests, and quizzes you’ve started and completed; content purchases and credits; your exchanges with instructors, teaching assistants, and other students; and essays, answers to questions, and other items submitted to satisfy course and related content requirements.
      </p>

      <h3>Student Payment Data</h3>
      <p>
        If you make purchases, we collect certain data about your purchase (such as your name, billing address, and ZIP code) as necessary to process your order and which may optionally be saved to process future orders. You must provide certain payment and billing data directly to our payment service providers, including your name, credit card information, billing address, and ZIP code. We may also receive limited information, like the fact that you have a new card and the last four digits of that card, from payment service providers to facilitate payments. For security, IT ACCURATE does not collect or store sensitive cardholder data, such as full credit card numbers or card authentication data.
