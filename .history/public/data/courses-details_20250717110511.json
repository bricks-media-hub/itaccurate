                    "question": "Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: What’s the difference?",
                    "answer": "In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset with input-output pairs, while unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, aiming to find patterns or relationships within the data."

                {
                    "question": "What is a Neural Network?",

                    "question": "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
                    "answer": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or outliers and performing poorly on new, unseen data. It’s essential to strike a balance to create a model that generalizes well."
                },
                {
                    "question": "What is feature engineering?",

                    "question": "Explain precision and recall in classification",
                    "answer": "Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall gauges the ability of a model to capture all relevant instances. Balancing both is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation of a classifier."

                {
                    "question": "What is reinforcement learning?",
                    "answer": "Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make sequences of decisions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. It’s often used in tasks where an agent learns to navigate and make decisions through trial and error."

                {
                    "question": "What is the role of hyperparameters in machine learning?",
                    "answer": "Hyperparameters are settings external to the model that affect its learning process. Examples include learning rates and regularization parameters. Tuning these hyperparameters is crucial for optimizing a model’s performance."

                {
                    "question": "How does deep learning differ from traditional machine learning?",
